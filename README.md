# Interviewer

This program simulates a pseudo-automated interviewing session. The interviewer at this current time will be Homer Simpson.

Before an applicant can proceed, s/he must enter a first and last name and choose an available position.
The applicant will be greeted by Homer Simpson then proceed to answer multiple choice questions.
For each question, the applicant must choose an answer; Homer will respond with an answer that relates to each question. 
If the candidate waits too long to answer, Homer will respond with one of his random taunts until an answer is chosen or the applicant exits the interview.
The candidate may exit the program at any time which will also trigger a response from Homer -- most likely, a sarcastic one.

Once the applicant has completed the interview, s/he will be greeted with a message of what to expect next. Nothing will happen after that so do not expect to get any further responses.
